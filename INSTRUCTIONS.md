The circuit boards are electronically the same, one uses thru-hole parts for easier assembly. The thru-hole board uses heat sinks that can be soldered to the board for rigidity.

Many web-based PCB houses will accept an EagleCAD .brd file for manufacturing.

The firmware has been merged with the main MaslowCNC Firmware branch. Use the Arduino IDE to upload the master firmware to control the TLE5206 board.
